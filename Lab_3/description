ALU consists of three parts: calculation, logic and control. 
The computational part performs operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.
In the logical part, operations such as NOT, XOR, OR, AND and NOR are performed.
Finally, the control department is responsible for determining the operational unit and the desired operation. 
In this experiment, the goal is to implement a very simple ALU like this:
operation    description    sel1    sel0
   not         not A         0        0
   nand        ~(A&B)        0        1
   add          A+B          1        0
   multiply     A*B          1        1
