Intelligent system design (attached system photo):
The system is initially in "idle" mode (000 mode.) The user must first activate the Request input,
Enter the system into "active" mode (mode 001.) Then the system waits for the user to enter a 4-bit password
And press the Confirm button. If the password is correct, the system enters the mode
Is "requested" (mode 101) and otherwise, the system goes to telephoto mode (mode 111). If the system
Enter "Request" mode, wait for the user to enter a 4-bit data and press the Confirm button
Select to store the information system in the corresponding registers at the active edge of the next clock (110 mode).
In all these steps, if the user resets the Request input to zero, the system immediately goes into "idle" mode. data
One must be stored in one register and even data in another register.
10.3) Draw the system state machine diagram by considering the following figure to implement the system.
10.4) Based on the designed mode diagram, the system is designed using a finite mode machine (FSM) and with
Describe the Verilog language. Then simulate your design.
